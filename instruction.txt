I have used i2pdf tool for converting pdf to html and pdf to image
I have created a repo with readme file option
then I have added the html and pdf files
then go to settings then at the right bar there is pages
then at pages I have selected main and save
after sometime there is an url at the top
for image in readme,I go to issues.upload the im age and just copy the url and nothing change.then I have pasted the url to the readme file(at readme file at the right top,there is a pen sign here I can add the url) then commit changes.
